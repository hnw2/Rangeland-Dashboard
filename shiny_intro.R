#### Intro to Shiny

# This script will load our first examples of Shiny apps. Shiny is an R package that allows you to build
# interactive web applications inside R. This will allow us to format and share data from the USSES in
# an accessible, customisable way with stakeholders and the public.

# If you have not already done so, please install the package. 
install.packages("shiny")

# Once you've installed R Shiny, you can load it in your environment:
library(shiny)
